## Values

This section presents my personal values and how that manifests as a vision, purpose, code of behaviour and list of goals.

The **context** section presents a bit of history behind these values, since this is not the first time I've been through this process of self-reflection.

<summary>Context</summary>

<summary>Vision, Purpose, Code of conduct</summary>

<div markdown='1'>

### Vision

> Approachable by all in good times and in times of need. A reliable husband, parent and teacher whose word is a guarantee. An inspiring model of continuous improvement.

### Purpose

> My purpose is to build confidence in others and inspire them to pursue their dreams. Part of that journey, for all of us, involves
> growing beyond fear to be more caring and gentle. Ultimately, I dream of a world where all of us are connected by common values and experiences, 
> not divided by ideological or cultural differences.

### Identity

> I am a bilingual Canadian father with Irish heritage and a love of rhythms from all around the world.
> I am curious, intelligent, enthusiastic, youthful and athletic.
> I believe in "one tribe" - a shared humanity - in mutual respect and care and in a mentality of improve or perish.

### Personal Code of Conduct

<blockquote markdown=1>

I may not always commit to all tasks or challenges put before me, but any that I do accept, I engage with to the best of my abilities: 
- setting aside time, thought and energy; 
- checking to see if my progress is to the "client's" satisfaction;
- correcting mistakes and making up for failings;
- seeing the work through to the end

I call this process "excellence". For me, excellence is not a state nor an achievement but a process of continually getting better for yourself and for the people you work with and work for. I originally defined excellence in this way in 2008 for a soccer team I coached. The original can be found in the [context section](#coaching-soccer) above. Since I've begun my karate journey, I immediately recognised **kaizen** as a very similar, if not identical, concept.
