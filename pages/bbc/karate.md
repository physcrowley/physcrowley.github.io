### Three-Month Goal

In the next three months, following the July progress check, I will achieve the following advancements in my karate practice:

1. **Flexibility**: Higher kicks because they are cool ðŸ˜Ž. Specifically,
   - At least 5cm on each of mae geri kekomi and keage, yoko geri keage and kekomi, mawashi geri and outside crescent kick.
2. **Strength**: Knee and shoulder stability so I can use my power more effectively and protect my body long-term. Specifically :
   - No instances of shoulder blade winging on single-arm TRX presses;
   - Reduced (close to no) instances of sideways knee deflection during movements of Heian Shodan and;
   - An oi zuki check by an instructor reveals improved connection and stability
3. **Skill**: more fluidity with ukemi, _ippon seoi nage_ and _o soto gari_ so I can safely and effectively practice more advanced goshin and bunkai. Specifically,
   - left and right shoulder rolls move straight ahead each time and keep the spine off the mat during the break fall
   - back roll on both left and right side keep the head off the mat 4 times out of 5.
   - improved mechanics and fluidity on ippon seonagi so my uki lands in front of me each time with their back off the mat
   - proper precision and follow through on the o soto gari to safely reap the legs 9 times out of 10.

#### Kicks

Gabriel Vargas has been an inspiration for me recently and has many excellent kick mobility tutorials to choose from. I will work on one or another of the following for several weeks at a time, switching based on progress, observed need and simple variety.

Exercice list

1. Raised hamstring stretch (toes up, drop chest) -> Pivot to side kick position and raise kicking leg -> Pivot to quad/hip flexor stretch/Bulgarian squat
   - 10x per leg
   - Adjust starting height: higher = harder
2. Frog pose with legs in 90 degrees, calves parallel : rock back and forth 3x -> windsheild wipers 3x per side -> pivot to quick glute stretch/child pose 1x per side
   - 10x
3. Standing, supported kick stretch with standing foot pivoted out : pull knee up with free hand with heel raised to the side -> extend lower leg to full round kick -> release leg and raise straight leg for height, using momentum -> snap kick
   - each exercice 3x
   - set of 10

#### Strength

I have two approaches here: one is general bullet-proofing and the other is hip mechanics and karate coordination.

For bullet-proofing, I will pick up the ATG Coaching Zero program I used before in the years before joining the dojo.

> Exercise list (combines part of the upper body workout and all of the lower body workout)
>
> - Upper body superset : TRX single arm press -> TRX inverted row -> Band pull aparts
>   - 10 reps per exercise
>   - 2-3 sets
>   - band pull apart variations :
>     - with thumbs pointed back;
>     - start from high and bring down to chest as you pull;
>     - replace with 3 sets of 10 band face-pulls;
>     - replace with seated shoulder cuff rotations (elbow on knee, arm at 90 degrees, with dumbell: 3x 10 reps each side)
> - 10x 1min reverse steps with band
> - 25x tibialis raise
> - 25x straight leg (gastroc) calf raise -> progess to single-leg
> - 25x tibialis raise
> - 25x knees over toes calf (soleus) raise -> progress to single-leg
> - 25x Patrick step (standing forward reach on one leg)
> - 5x ATG split squat per side x5 sets
> - Mobility superset (2-3sets) : 30x elephant walk -> (1 min) L-sit progressions -> Couch stretch

For hip mechanics and coordination, I have found a great Shotokan dojo in France lead by Bertrand Jaillet that produced many kihon tutorials during the pandemic. I will use a select few for hip strenthening, movement pattern improvement and whole-body coordination.

#### Checks

| Goal | Test |
| --- | --- |
| Kicks | Mark/Tape on point on wall from a fixed distance for each kick |
| Stability | Shoulder = random self-check with free hand during TRX press; Knee = film Heian Shodan and count lateral deflections; Oi zuki = check by instructor for alignment and stability |
| Skill | Shoulder roll to side break fall = film and count number/degree of deflection from staight line; Back roll = film and count number of head contacts; Ippon seoi nage = challenge instructor for a grade |

#### When

| Week | Description                 |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Baseline values             |
| 3    | Quarter of the way          |
| 7    | Midpoint and progress check |
| 14   | Final check                 |

### One-Year Goal

</div>

<div markdown='1'>

### Black Belt Grading Date

> Fall 2030 give or take 6 months.

This projected date assumes an 8 month per belt rate (green through purple advanced) and one year for the brown belt.

The black belt itself isn't important in itself , but it is a goal that allows me to practice "excellence" / kaizen / continuous improvement.

It will also be a sign of my physical ability when I'm 49, setting me up for the "fit in my 50s" goal and an active life with my wife as our children become adults.
