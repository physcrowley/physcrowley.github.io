## Karate

### Three-Month Goal

In the next three months, following the July progress check, I will achieve the following advancements in my karate practice:

1. **Flexibility**: Higher kicks because they are cool ðŸ˜Ž. Specifically, 
   - At least 5cm on each of mae geri kekomi and keage, yoko geri keage and kekomi, mawashi geri and outside crescent kick.
2. **Strength**: Knee and shoulder stability so I can use my power more effectively and protect my body long-term. Specifically :
   - No instances of shoulder blade winging on single-arm TRX presses;
   - Reduced (close to no) instances of sideways knee deflection during movements of Heian Shodan and;
   - An oi zuki check by an instructor reveals improved connection and stability
3. **Skill**: more fluidity with ukemi, ippon seonage and o soto gari so I can safely and effectively practice more advanced goshin and bunkai. Specifically,
   - left and right shoulder rolls move straight ahead each time and keep the spine off the mat during the break fall
   - back roll on both left and right side keep the head off the mat 4 times out of 5.
   - improved mechanics and fluidity on ippon seonagi so my uki lands in front of me each time with their back off the mat
   - proper precision and follow through on the o soto gari to safely reap the legs 9 times out of 10.

#### Kicks

Gabriel Vargas has been an inspiration for me recently and has many excellent kick mobility tutorials to choose from. I will work on one or another of the following for several weeks at a time, switching based on progress, observed need and simple variety.

#### Strength

I have two approaches here: one is general bullet-proofing and the other is hip mechanics and karate coordination.

For bullet-proofing, I will pick up the ATG Coaching Zero program I used before in the years before joining the dojo.

For hip mechanics and coordination, I have found a great Shotokan dojo in France lead by Bertrand Jaillet that produced many kihon tutorials during the pandemic. I will use a select few for hip strenthening, movement pattern improvement and whole-body coordination.

### One-Year Goal




### Black Belt Grading Date

> Fall 2030 give or take 6 months.

This projected date assumes an 8 month per belt rate (green through purple advanced) and one year for the brown belt.

The black belt itself isn't important in itself , but it is a goal that allows me to practice "excellence" / kaizen / continuous improvement.

It will also be a sign of my physical ability when I'm 49, setting me up for the "fit in my 50s" goal and an active life with my wife as our children become adults.
