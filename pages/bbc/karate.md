## Karate

### Three-Month Goal


### One-Year Goal


### Black Belt Grading Date

> Fall 2030 give or take 6 months.

This projected date assumes an 8 month per belt rate (green through purple advanced) and one year for the brown belt.

The black belt itself isn't important in itself , but it is a goal that allows me to practice "excellence" / kaizen / continuous improvement.

It will also be a sign of my physical ability when I'm 49, setting me up for the "fit in my 50s" goal and an active life with my wife as our children become adults.
