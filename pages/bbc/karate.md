### Three-Month Goal

In the next three months, following the July progress check, I will achieve the following advancements in my karate practice:

1. **Flexibility**: Higher kicks because they are cool ðŸ˜Ž. Specifically,
   - At least 5cm on each of mae geri kekomi and keage, yoko geri keage and kekomi, mawashi geri and outside crescent kick.
2. **Strength**: Knee and shoulder stability so I can use my power more effectively and protect my body long-term. Specifically :
   - No instances of shoulder blade winging on single-arm TRX presses;
   - Reduced (close to no) instances of sideways knee deflection during movements of Heian Shodan and;
   - An oi zuki check by an instructor reveals improved connection and stability
3. **Skill**: more fluidity with ukemi, _ippon seoi nage_ and _o soto gari_ so I can safely and effectively practice more advanced goshin and bunkai. Specifically,
   - left and right shoulder rolls move straight ahead each time and keep the spine off the mat during the break fall
   - back roll on both left and right side keep the head off the mat 4 times out of 5.
   - improved mechanics and fluidity on ippon seonagi so my uki lands in front of me each time with their back off the mat
   - proper precision and follow through on the o soto gari to safely reap the legs 9 times out of 10.

#### Kicks

Gabriel Vargas has been an inspiration for me recently and has many excellent kick mobility tutorials to choose from. I will work on one or another of the following for several weeks at a time, switching based on progress, observed need and simple variety.

> [3 Exercises That Fix 90% Of High Kick Struggles](https://youtu.be/o4FUCiew7zU?si=ARj1r7cBnAUOGBxY&t=145)
>
> Exercice list
>
> 1. Raised hamstring stretch (toes up, drop chest) -> Pivot to side kick position and raise kicking leg -> Pivot to quad/hip flexor stretch/Bulgarian squat
>    - 10x per leg
>    - Adjust starting height: higher = harder
> 2. Frog pose with legs in 90 degrees, calves parallel : rock back and forth 3x -> windsheild wipers 3x per side -> pivot to quick glute stretch/child pose 1x per > side
>    - 10x
> 3. Standing, supported kick stretch with standing foot pivoted out : pull knee up with free hand with heel raised to the side -> extend lower leg to full round kick -> release leg and raise straight leg for height, using momentum -> snap kick
>    - each exercice 3x
>    - set of 10

- [How To Get HIGHER Kicks](https://youtu.be/IbVjc1Kl0lI?si=xQe8mcRQIWsAxkGd&t=120)

#### Strength

I have two approaches here: one is general bullet-proofing and the other is hip mechanics and karate coordination.

For **bullet-proofing**, I will pick up the ATG Coaching Zero program I used before in the years before joining the dojo.

> - [ATG Online Coaching Website](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/)
> - [ATG Blog](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/articles)
>
> Exercise list (combines part of the upper body workout and all of the lower body workout)
>
> - Upper body superset : TRX single arm press -> TRX inverted row -> Band pull aparts
>   - 10 reps per exercise
>   - 2-3 sets
>   - band pull apart variations :
>     - with thumbs pointed back;
>     - start from high and bring down to chest as you pull;
>     - replace with 3 sets of 10 band face-pulls;
>     - replace with seated shoulder cuff rotations (elbow on knee, arm at 90 degrees, with dumbell: 3x 10 reps each side)
> - 10x 1min reverse steps with band
> - 25x tibialis raise
> - 25x straight leg (gastroc) calf raise -> progess to single-leg
> - 25x tibialis raise
> - 25x knees over toes calf (soleus) raise -> progress to single-leg
> - 25x Patrick step (standing forward reach on one leg)
> - 5x ATG split squat per side x5 sets
> - Mobility superset (2-3sets) : 30x elephant walk -> (1 min) L-sit progressions -> Couch stretch

For **hip mechanics and coordination**, I have found a great Shotokan dojo in France lead by Bertrand Jaillet that produced many kihon tutorials during the pandemic. I will use a select few for hip strenthening, movement pattern improvement and whole-body coordination.

> Exercise sequence based on _zenkutsu dachi_ that progressively integrates punching and blocking mechanics for full-body coordination.

#### Skill

For training skill, it is simply a matter of practicing my breakfalls and my throws on the mat after class and getting feedback from my _uki_, from the instructors and from analysing film myself.

<summary>Rewards and Stakes</summary>

<div markdown='1'>

#### Rewards

The absolute top reward will be that bullet-proofed, coordinated body that can continue practicing karate and a wide variety of other physical activities into the foreseeable future. Notably, I can have confidence that my body will be able to handle the ongoing journey towards my black belt.

For small, routine achievements, I will have:

- journal entries
- verbal self-affirmations
- a progress board filled with stars

For a larger reward if I hit more than 80% of my planned workouts, I would get a [Bells of Steel kettlebell](https://www.amazon.ca/Adjustable-Bells-Steel-Internally-Loaded-Competition/dp/B0D38BLJQW) as an upgrade to the 25lb ones I currently have.

#### Stakes

Again, the biggest stakes of failure are not sufficiently building my physical capacity and having to drop the intensity of my training, and possibly reducing load in other aspects of my life. I really get grumpy and restless when I'm injured! Nobody wants that!

As forfeits :

- for missing a single workout: 30 minutes less evening entertainment, converted to an earlier bedtime that day and an earlier rise the next morning.
- for missing 2 workouts in a week: zero screen-time in the evening plus the single-workout forfeit
- for missing more than 20% of workouts from one check-point to the next: the above 2-miss forfeit applies automatically for the next week.

The aim here is to annoy me while also providing space for rest and potentially building better sleep habits as a by-product of this karate goal.

<summary>Checkpoints</summary>

<div markdown='1'>

#### Test for Progress on Kicks

> - Place a mark or a piece of tape on wall at the height reached from a fixed distance for each kick

#### Test for Progress on Stability

> - Shoulder: random self-check with free hand during TRX press
> - Knee: film Heian Shodan and count lateral deflections
> - Oi zuki: check by instructor for alignment and stability

#### Test for Progress on Skill

> - Shoulder roll to side break fall: film and count number/degree of deflection from staight line
> - Back roll: film and count number of head contacts
> - Ippon seoi nage = challenge instructor for a grade

<summary>Training and Assessment Calendar</summary>

<div markdown='1'>

For this short-term goal, I have the following base calendar:

| Day                         |    Time    | Workout                          |

### One-Year Goal

My goal for one year from now is very simple.

> No more corrections on the posture or alignment of my front, back and horse stances, nor on the fundamental mechanics of movement between those stances, nor on the delivery of low, rising, outside, inside or knifehand blocks from those stances.

This goal is not about adding advanced mechanics to the basic stances and transitions but about having a fundamentally sound base of posture and movement from which to build.

The reason is so that I can free my mind and my body for more advanced sequences and techniques that rely on these fundamental ones in full confidence that my techniques are effective and safe.

</div>

<div markdown='1'>

### Black Belt Grading Date

> Fall 2030 give or take 6 months.

This projected date assumes an 8 month per belt rate (green through purple advanced) and one year for the brown belt.

The black belt itself isn't important in itself , but it is a goal that allows me to practice "excellence" / kaizen / continuous improvement.

It will also be a sign of my physical ability when I'm 49, setting me up for the "fit in my 50s" goal and an active life with my wife as our children become adults.
