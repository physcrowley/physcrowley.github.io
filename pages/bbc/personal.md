### Three-Month Goal

In the next three months, over the course of the summer and through the start of the 2025-2026 school year, I will rework my class materials for the computer science classes - especially the unit organisation and assessment - in order to make it more sustainable to manage and to provide better official feedback to students.

> Specifically, :
>
> - all assessments will be modular and listed as part of a contract
> - there will be accompanying notes and exercises available for each module (reworked from existing)
> - each student will do projects based on their interests while making sure that they are learning items from their contract as they progress
> - assessment related to contract items will happen at a known frequency, with each students' assessment composed of items they have completed since the last assessemnt
> - explore retake possibilities since many, many contract items are used in almost every computer program
> - automatic or semi-automatic grading of written assessments
> - interview process linking contract items assessed and code produced, ideally with a fully-know structure from day one.
> - structure accommodating split-level classes where grade 11 and grade 12 students are following different contracts in parallel with each other
> - introduce junior / senior mechanics to enhance learning and leverage the experience of the older students

I will consider this goal to be **fully achieved** if:

1. I have a modular assessment system that is available from the first day of school.
2. All course materials have been adjusted to fit the new modules by the first day of school.

It will be a **bonus** to achieve this as well:

- Have junior / senior interactions programmed into each course

<summary>Implementation</summary>

<div markdown='1'>

The best time for an overhaul like this is when I am not seeing the students during the day. Cue the summer vacation. Considering all the action over the summer, I see the following **possibilities for work**:

- while both kids are at camp, I will have about 3 hours per day between drop-off and pick-up
- on other days, I will have about 30 minutes in the morning before breakfast and another hour while the kids have their game time
- on the weekends, I may be able to get an extra hour before breakfast
- no time at the cottage or when camping

To make my work at producing documents more efficient, especially since I have a lot of existing personalised material to start with, I would like to try and **leverage an AI agent** to both help:

- creating the structure for the system
- creating templates for contracts, assessments, and interviews and filling them with appropiate informaton
- building the automations required for the personalised assessments
- generating assessment items that match my course materials and the level of the students

<summary>Rewards and Stakes</summary>

<div markdown='1'>

#### Rewards

The absolute top reward will life-balance! üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That is the biggest driver and a massive requirement for me to achieve my vision and purpose.

Not having to hear _"when will we be getting our grades back for X?"_ after they have written it will be a massive professional achievement. A first all-time if I can pull off a true zero in any class.

While I am working on reaching the goals that will get me those larger rewards, I also have the following planned for achieving each work session:

- journal entries
- verbal self-affirmations
- a progress board filled with stars

If I can get ahead of my planned progress, I may reorganise my schedule to replace a work session with a date with my wife. This would be a massive reversal and a huge win. This reward will also hold during the school year if my system truly does reduce the take-home workload from previous years.

Also during the school year, I truly believe this approach will lead to way more personal and effective interactions with each of my students and be a step up on the "Inspiration For My Students" part of the vision.

#### Stakes

The stakes for failing to reach this goal are huge!

- My school year will be overloaded as I try to complete this work as well as managing my classes
- My life at home will suffer
- My relationship with my wife will suffer

So while I am working during the summer, I have the following forfeit planned:

- for missing a work session: replace evening entertainment (often Youtube) with work, while respecting the bedtimes I have set-up

During the school year, I have also planned on:

- crowd-sourcing forfeits for delayed correcting by asking my students to suggest appropriate compensations that must be delivered if I do not meet established feedback deadlines. I imagine things like pay-outs in candy, free time, or wearing silly items.

<details>

<summary>Checkpoints</summary>

<div markdown='1'>

#### Tools

I will use the following tools to keep track of my progress:

- [Flow State](https://enter.ourflowstate.com/) "Time and Task" chat where I post estimated time and name of task then repost the actual time required. This chat is used by others for the same purpose. 
  - _I have been using Bobby Lyte's Flow State podcasts for years and did not cancel my Patreon subscription even during the leanest of the post-pandemic years. He has helped me get better at using the time that I must structure for myself._
  - _The tool of his I actually use on the regular, aside from the chat, is the [daily playlist](https://www.flowstateradio.com/) which has been progressively optimised to reduce distraction_
- Pocket notebook with checklists
- Files generated

#### Progress

- On every day with a planned work session, I will compare planned time-on-task with actual time-on-task
- At the checkpoints planned in the Routines and Assessment section below, I will compile and review time on task to determine overall progress.

Checkpoints are placed :

1. After camp weeks (big time available)
2. Before hitting the cottage
3. The day before class starts
4. The last day of the Labour Day long weekend
5. 3 weeks after Labour Day
6. At the end

### Medium-Term (1 to 10 year) Goal

My medium and long term goals both focus heavily on becoming more gentle and available and in continuing to help build others up. My [vision board](./values.md#vision-board-2024) really sums up effectively what I am aiming to achieve.

#### Inspiration For My Students

Following on from the 3-month goal, the next 2 school years will be about refining the systems so that all of us get what we need as a matter of course and can focus our energy on interacting during class. By the end of the 2026-2027 school year, I would like to be primarily a student-focused teacher who can rely on effective and balanced systems for the day-to-day management of the class.

#### Model For My Children

Those balanced systems at work will help my students, but the broader objective is work-life balance. Considering my own children, this means :

- the school year is a balanced as the summer (vacation) months, i.e. I am just as involved emotionally in their daily lives no matter the time of the year;
- they are confident, autonomous, respectful and kind children who have grown through their struggles and their ability to rely on both of their parents for support and guidance.

#### Close As A Couple

Similarly, the improved work-life balance will have an enormous impact on my relationship with my wife. This is a primary driver because any problems I have with that balance usually end up being her problems in one way or another and the strain is unsustainable for both of us.

> Me finding balance is key to my wife finding balance within our couple.

By the Fall of 2025, even as I refine my work systems, my goal is to spend **regular one-on-one time** with her:

- taking the time to share evening entertainment
- going on dates at least once a month

#### Fit In 50's

My karate training is my strategy for achieving this, but I would not want to be physically active alone.

My wife has many chronic injuries and niggles so I would also like her to be **generally pain-free in her joints and muscles** by the summer of 2026. I found many years ago that just increasing baseline, overall strength did as much for preventing the recurrence of my own physical issues as following the prescribed rehab exercises for any specific injury. I have invited her to train with me on the ATG strength and stability program's upper body portion. I hope by training as a couple, she may finally take a favorable view to strength training and get to enjoy these benefits as well.

Then we can both be fit in our 50's and enjoy each others company while walking, hiking, biking, paddling and maybe even running together.

### Long-Term (10+ year) Goal

The long term goal has to branches to it: how we use our success to help our families and what we are doing with our time.

#### Supporting Our Families

The success and prosperity our careers bring us should put us in a position where all of our parents can live well in their old age. I see us having my wife's parents and sister living with us and working with my other siblings to make sure my mom has a place with my sister and my dad and step-mom have a place with my brothers if they need it.

#### Having Cool Retirement Projects

After a professional teaching career (and a professional nursing career for my wife), it would be great to continue using our gifts while enjoying the greater freedom of schedule.

My full pension date with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is 2037. By then, I would like to have explored possibilities and taken the opportunities to set up interesting projects in:

- a robotics or coding club/team for disadvantaged children
- a coffee or bike shop
- living the cottage life
- teaching at the dojo
