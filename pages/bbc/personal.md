### Three-Month Goal

### Medium-Term (1 to 10 year) Goal

My medium and long term goals both focus heavily on becoming more gentle and available and in continuing to help build others up. My [vision board](./values.md#vision-board-2024) really sums up effectively what I am aiming to achieve.

#### Inspiration For My Students

Following on from the 3-month goal, the next 2 school years will be about refining the systems so that all of us get what we need as a matter of course and can focus our energy on interacting during class. By the end of the 2026-2027 school year, I would like to be primarily a student-focused teacher who can rely on effective and balanced systems for the day-to-day management of the class.

#### Model For My Children

Those balanced systems at work will help my students, but the broader objective is work-life balance. Considering my own children, this means :

- the school year is a balanced as the summer (vacation) months, i.e. I am just as involved emotionally in their daily lives no matter the time of the year;
- they are confident, autonomous, respectful and kind children who have grown through their struggles and their ability to rely on both of their parents for support and guidance.

#### Close As A Couple

Similarly, the improved work-life balance will have an enormous impact on my relationship with my wife. This is a primary driver because any problems I have with that balance usually end up being her problems in one way or another and the strain is unsustainable for both of us.

> Me finding balance is key to my wife finding balance within our couple.

By the Fall of 2025, even as I refine my work systems, my goal is to spend **regular one-on-one time** with her:

- taking the time to share evening entertainment
- going on dates at least once a month

#### Fit In 50's

My karate training is my strategy for achieving this, but I would not want to be physically active alone.

My wife has many chronic injuries and niggles so I would also like her to be **generally pain-free in her joints and muscles** by the summer of 2026. I found many years ago that just increasing baseline, overall strength did as much for preventing the recurrence of my own physical issues as following the prescribed rehab exercises for any specific injury. I have invited her to train with me on the ATG strength and stability program's upper body portion. I hope by training as a couple, she may finally take a favorable view to strength training and get to enjoy these benefits as well. 

Then we can both be fit in our 50's and enjoy each others company while walking, hiking, biking, paddling and maybe even running together.

### Long-Term (10+ year) Goal

The long term goal has to branches to it: how we use our success to help our families and what we are doing with our time.

#### Supporting Our Families

The success and prosperity our careers bring us should put us in a position where all of our parents can live well in their old age. I see us having my wife's parents and sister living with us and working with my other siblings to make sure my mom has a place with my sister and my dad and step-mom have a place with my brothers if they need it.

#### Having Cool Retirement Projects

After a professional teaching career (and a professional nursing career for my wife), it would be great to continue using our gifts while enjoying the greater freedom of schedule.

My full pension date with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is 2037. By then, I would like to have explored possibilities and taken the opportunities to set up interesting projects in:

- a robotics or coding club/team for disadvantaged children
- a coffee or bike shop
- living the cottage life
- teaching at the dojo
