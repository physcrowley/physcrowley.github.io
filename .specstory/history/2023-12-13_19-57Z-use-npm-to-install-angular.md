use npm to install angular

---

_**Assistant**_

To install Angular using npm, you need to first install Node.js and npm on your system. After that, you can install Angular CLI globally using npm. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
# Check if Node.js and npm are installed
node -v
npm -v

# If Node.js and npm are installed, you can install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This command installs the Angular CLI globally on your system which allows you to use the `ng` command from anywhere in your system.

create new angular project

_**Assistant**_

To create a new Angular project, you can use the Angular CLI's `new` command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
ng new my-angular-project
```

Replace `my-angular-project` with the name you want for your project. This command will create a new directory with the same name as your project, and it will set up the necessary files and directories for an Angular application.

You will be asked a couple of questions during the setup:

- Would you like to add Angular routing? (yes/no)
- Which stylesheet format would you like to use? (CSS/SCSS/SASS/LESS/Stylus)

You can choose according to your preference.

remove angular project

_**Assistant**_

To remove an Angular project, you simply need to delete the project directory. This can be done using the `rm` command in the terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
rm -rf my-angular-project
```

Replace `my-angular-project` with the name of your Angular project. This command will delete the project directory and all of its contents. Be careful with this command, as it will permanently delete the specified directory and its contents.

remove angular installation

---

_**Assistant**_

To remove Angular CLI, you can use the npm uninstall command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
```

This command will remove the Angular CLI from your system. If you want to remove a specific Angular project, you can delete the project directory as I mentioned in the previous response.
